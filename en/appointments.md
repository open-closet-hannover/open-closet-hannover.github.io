**June 17th: Physio workshop with Judith from FYN Atheletes CANCELED**<br>
15:15-18:45. At queeres Wohnzimmer ("queer living room") at the city library, Hildesheimer Str. 12.

The workshop will take part in German. The rooms are wheelchair-accessible. The barrier-reduced toilets are binary gendered.

15:15 Part 1: Everyday movement
for TINAQ\* (trans\*, inter\*, nonbinary, agender, questioning)<br>

The first part of the workshop is about getting to know a sensible approach to physical activity in everyday life. The basis is a keynote speech on our body and its functions, common (mis)assumptions about posture and pain, as well as insights into the positive effect of movement on all areas of our life and being.

This is followed by examples, tips and tricks for practical implementation in often stressful everyday life. Are you wondering how you can integrate more movement into your everyday life? And especially in what form? In the practical part, which invites you to try out exercises yourself, you will find answers to these questions.

17:15 Part 2: Body knowledge and excercises for people who wear binders

In the second part of the workshop, we will look specifically at the topic of "wearing a binder". What happens when the rib cage is constantly subjected to strong compression? How does this potentially affect the body's functions? These and other questions will be explored in the keynote speech in order to provide participants with a knowledge base for practical implementation.

In the practical part, we will explore various exercises together in order to counteract the effects of wearing binders. Questions and issues raised by the participants can also be addressed in a needs-oriented manner.

**June 23: Make-up workshop with Obara**

In this workshop we want to break down fears of contact and try things out together. There will be an informative part and a practical part.

There will be some material, but if you already have make-up, feel free to bring it with you.

It is ok if you have no experience with make-up or if you already have some experience.

The workshop will be led by Obara, a young trans woman. She has been using make-up since she was 12 years old so she already has a lot of experience and is happy to pass on her knowledge.

The workshop is free and takes place on 23.06.24 from 14-17 o'clock in the cultural center Pavillon (Listermeile 4, 30161 Hannover).

The room is wheelchair accessible and there are accessible toilets.
