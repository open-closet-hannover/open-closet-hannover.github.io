**July 18th: Turtle Touch - Slow Embodied Pleasure Work/Playshop 4 Queers**

When: July 18, 2024 from 6 - 9 p.m.

Where? will be announced

Open to queer bodies aged 18 and over ðŸ™‚

Slowly, like a turtle, we move towards the edges of our comfort zones: out of curiosity and wanderlust, to expand our own boundaries.

Slow Embodied Pleasure means a slow, shared approach and feeling our way towards what we want, what is good for us, what we want to share with each other through our gaze and touch. We explore self-touch and ways to come into contact with each other in a mindful and pleasurable way. This is not about sexual arousal but about pleasurable contact with ourselves and other bodies.

With playful methods and the invitation to dare to do something new, we move out of our shells.

This work/playshop is a sex-positive space in the sense that all sexualities on the spectrum are invited - people who locate themselves on the ace-spectrum are expressly invited. This work/playshop is not an explicitly sexual space. All participants are clothed at all times. There will be awareness agreements for the space, which all participants agree to with their registration.

Participation is free of charge. The workshop can be held in German and English.

Accessibility information about the space will follow

Come with Care and Curiosity!

About me:

Jespa (none/ jespa/they; white-bodied, mostly able bodied)
Assigned fabulous at birth, neuro-spicy. I research shame, masculinities and queer temporality and the connections between the human and non-human worlds.  Inspired by a love of movement, touch and constant change.
I am certified in Sexological Bodywork (ISB Berlin). Besides queer and trans-focused bodywork, I am also part of the artistic direction of the "Bonanzafest Cologne - Festival for trans and non-binary art and performance" in Cologne and the HOTHOTHOT_collective for the exploration of queer erotics with the non-human world.
